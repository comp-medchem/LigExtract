![](docs/sources/images/ligextract_logo.png)


Software that allows large-scale ligand extraction from UniProt ID queries.

Below is the overall workflow of LigExtract:

## Dependencies

LigExtract was developed on Linux and written in Python 3. It requires PyMol to be installed and, to avoid issues with properly interfacing with a system-wide PyMOL, the ligextract env has its own pymol installation.

Once you have installed the conda env provided and have activated it, you can run the command below to check if PyMOL can be used properly within the LigExtract environment.

    pymol -cq


## Running LigExtract

**1.** git clone LigExtract into your home directory. Make ligextract.sh and build_dependencies.sh inside of bin executable (i.e. chmod 755 *.sh). Add path to LigExtract/bin to your $PATH environment.

**2.** create a conda environment from ligextract.yml, and activate it.

**3.** cd into your working directory. This is where all PDBs will be downloaded and processed. This directory must contain a file with a name following the format 

        <projectname>_uniprot_list.txt

For example, my project is called "myproteins" so the file will be named
        
        myproteins_uniprot_list.txt

This file will contain a list of UniProt IDs (see example in docs)

**4.** Build dependencies (one-off downloads):
        
        build_dependencies.sh

**5.** Run LigExtract for your query proteins in your *_uniprot_list.txt file (without cleaning-up at the end). You can use the *cluster* mode if you want to keep all ligands (recommended for molecular docking, binding sites study, etc):

        ligextract.sh -d myproteins -r 2.5 -o cluster -c no
        
Alternatively use the *filter* mode when you want a list of deduplicated ligands:

        ligextract.sh -d myproteins -r 2.5 -o filter -c no


Cluster mode with clean-up at the end (i.e. removing all *.cif files):

        ligextract.sh -d myproteins -r 2.5 -o cluster -c yes

  In this example, ligextract will only consider PDBs up to 2.5 Angstrom resolution and will employ the "cluster" mode (i.e., all ligands that survive filtration are kept, even if duplicated)
  
  Notice how "myproteins" is the name provided to the -d argument, as this must correspond to the prefix of the *_uniprot_list.txt file.
  

## Outputs

#### Cluster mode:

Ligextract produces a table called **<projectname>_ligandClusters.txt**

ligandfile | pocketres_chain | pocketres_chain_size | chain_name | ligtype | lig_ID | pdbcode 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
1sb1_lig_chain-I.pdb | ARG67-H;(...);TYR76-H | 18 | H | chain ligand | 1sb1_lig_chain-I | 1sb1 


#### Alternative commands
  

#### Arguments of ligextract.sh:
     -h    usage information
     -d    name of the directory that will be created with all PDBs. This will be the prefix for multiple files.
     -r    maximum PDB resolution accepted
     -o    selected ligand selection mode: can be 'filter' or 'cluster'
     -c    cleaning outcome: 'yes' will delete cifs directory; 'no' will keep all *.cif files.
     -v    See installed version

     
#### Usage Notes:

- LigExtract will prompt the user to manually reject or accept each of all experiment method used to obtain the PDBs associated with the UniProt queries.
- LigExtract will replace 5-character ligand codes with a short numerical code (e.g.,A1AIM -> 01) everywhere, through the use of BeEM (mmCIF-to-pdb converter). The user can easily access the original ID in the *-ligand-id-mapping.tsv files for the corresponding PDB, inside cifs.
