Code maintenance plan:

- replace Ligand Expo (no longer maintained) with ligand information directly from the PDB archive at http://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd and the index file at https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/holdings/refdata_id_list.json.gz 

- Add warning if any of the dependency resources stops working and halt the process

- Add functionality to allow for PDB queries

- Add ability to handle structures with too many chains (structure file is split)
